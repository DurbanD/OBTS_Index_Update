## OBTS Index Improvements

Userscript that changes the behavior of the OBTS Admin Index page. Removes the current interval timers and replaces them with per-element updates that only change the content when said content changes. Index page will no longer refresh every 10 seconds. By default, all elements will check for updates every 10 seconds except for the Current Agent Status, which checks for updates every five seconds, or half the update interval of the other elements.

Install with a Userscript manager such as Tampermonkey.

A bit of a hack, **use at your own risk**.
